//! The About window - what it shows and how it opens
//! (`openspec/specs/about-ui`).
//!
//! It is a window rather than a dialog: an About box that blocks the window
//! it opened over is not what any desktop platform does, and the modal alert
//! this replaces could name neither the version nor the build. A single
//! instance, like the settings window - choosing About again raises the one
//! that is open.
//!
//! `build_info` answers which binary is running, `window` opens and owns the
//! window, `pane` draws it.
