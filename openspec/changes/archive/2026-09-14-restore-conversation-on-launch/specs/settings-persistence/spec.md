## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Single settings store

The system SHALL expose one settings surface holding scalar values (appearance
mode, restore-layout-on-launch, restore-conversation-on-launch,
keep-in-menu-bar, MCP enabled, MCP port default `8766`, source base folder,
notification toggle, markdown/mermaid view options, per-agent-type command and
options strings, terminal font name and size, and similar) and serialized
collections (saved agents, saved workspaces, personas, bench agents, recent
repos). Writing a value SHALL persist it immediately.

`restore-conversation-on-launch` defaults to off (disabled) and is
decode-tolerant: a persisted settings blob written before this field existed
SHALL load with it defaulted to off, not an error.

#### Scenario: Scalar persists across restart

- **WHEN** the MCP port is set to `9000` and the app restarts
- **THEN** the MCP port reads back as `9000`

#### Scenario: Restore-conversation-on-launch defaults off for legacy settings

- **WHEN** a persisted settings blob written before `restore-conversation-on-launch`
  existed is decoded
- **THEN** it loads successfully with `restore-conversation-on-launch` set to
  off

### Requirement: Durable agent field set

A persisted agent (`SavedAgent`) SHALL store exactly: id, name, avatar (a
non-empty string, default a robot emoji), folder, agent type (default
`claude`), created-by, is-companion, shell command, persona id, and an
optional session id. Loading SHALL reconstruct agents with all runtime fields
at defaults except session id, which SHALL be reconstructed from the
persisted value when present (see `agent-lifecycle` - Durable versus runtime
fields for how it is then used to resolve resume-session id).

Session id SHALL only ever be written to a non-`None` value when
`restore-conversation-on-launch` is enabled at persist time; whenever it is
disabled, saving an agent SHALL persist session id as `None` regardless of
the agent's runtime session id.

#### Scenario: Avatar default on save

- **WHEN** an agent with no avatar is saved
- **THEN** its persisted avatar is the default robot emoji

#### Scenario: Session id omitted by default

- **WHEN** `restore-conversation-on-launch` is disabled (the default) and an
  agent with an active runtime session id is saved
- **THEN** the persisted agent's session id is `None`

### Requirement: Decode-tolerant migration

Decoding a collection SHALL tolerate records that predate later fields:
`SavedAgent` and `BenchAgent` without created-by / is-companion / persona id
SHALL default those, and `SavedAgent` without session id SHALL default it to
`None`; a `Persona` without type / state SHALL default to user / enabled. A
collection blob that fails to decode SHALL yield an empty collection rather
than an error.

#### Scenario: Legacy SavedAgent record without session id

- **WHEN** a persisted `SavedAgent` record predates the session id field
- **THEN** it loads with session id defaulted to `None`

#### Scenario: Legacy persona record

- **WHEN** a stored persona has no `type` or `state`
- **THEN** it loads as a user persona in the enabled state

#### Scenario: Corrupt blob

- **WHEN** the saved-agents blob cannot be decoded
- **THEN** the loaded agent list is empty and the app still starts
